# Flex QR Overlay

A customizable, high-performance QR scanner overlay for Flutter apps. Built with **Clean Architecture**, this package provides a beautiful "cut-out" focus frame with a smooth, animated scanning laser line to enhance your user experience.



## Features

* **Customizable Focus Area:** Adjust the size, border radius, and color of the scanning rectangle.
* **Animated Scan Line:** A smooth, vertical "laser" animation that provides visual feedback to the user.
* **Clean Architecture:** Logic and presentation are separated, making it lightweight and easy to maintain.
* **Universal Compatibility:** Works as a layer on top of any camera package (e.g., `mobile_scanner`, `qr_code_scanner`).
